Project Description
A simple, single-page web application that challenges users to click a button 100 times to receive a "reward." The button moves randomly, shrinks as you progress, and occasionally rolls back your progress, all while offering sarcastic encouragement.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern life has become too easy. People need a grueling, pointless task to remind them of the value of persistence and the bitter taste of regret. We are solving the problem of having too much free time and too little mental anguish.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We are providing a digital endurance test disguised as a game. By forcing users to click a frustratingly elusive button 100 times, we offer a cathartic, character-building experience that culminates in a truly underwhelming reward.
